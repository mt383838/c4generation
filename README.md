*Generation of C4-Based Architecture Documentation Using Large Language Models (LLMs)*

## 📄 **Abstract**

This thesis presents the **first systematic evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs)** for generating software architecture documentation using the C4 model. A **manual reference architecture** was compared with **automated models generated by GPT-4o and a fine-tuned assistant ("C4 Designer")**, based on a real industrial use case in a regulated domain.

## 📊 **Evaluation**

The study is based on **two structured evaluations** to assess the quality and applicability of LLM-generated architecture documentation:

1. **Expert Review (Quantitative Evaluation – 3 Architects)**  
   Three independent software architects evaluated both the manually created and the LLM-generated C4 models. Using a detailed point-based rubric, they assessed key quality dimensions such as:
   - Clarity
   - Completeness
   - Consistency
   - Technical correctness

   → The manual documentation achieved an average of **50.5 out of 60 points**, while the LLM-based documentation reached **46.8 points**, which corresponds to **93%** of the manual benchmark.

2. **Expert Survey (Qualitative and Quantitative – 28 Domain Experts)**  
   A broader survey was conducted with 28 software professionals to capture perceptions of:
   - Time efficiency
   - Long-term usability
   - Confidence in AI-based documentation

   → Key findings:
   - **68%** of participants rated the LLM-based approach as more time-efficient  
   - **54%** would prefer LLM support for documentation in the long run  
   - The average confidence in AI replacing manual documentation was **7.7 out of 10**

These combined evaluations offer both **depth (expert benchmarking)** and **breadth (practitioner perspectives)** on the use of generative AI for C4 architecture documentation.

## ❓ **Research Questions**

1. **Time Efficiency**  
   Can LLMs reduce the time and effort required for C4 documentation?

2. **Quality Comparison**  
   Do LLM-generated models meet manual quality in clarity, correctness, and completeness?

3. **Expert Perspectives**  
   What are practitioners' views on strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of LLM-based documentation?
