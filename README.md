**Manual vs. ChatGPT-Based C4 Modeling**  
*Generation of C4-Based Architecture Documentation Using Large Language Models (LLMs)*

## 📄 **Abstract**

This thesis presents the **first systematic evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs)** for generating software architecture documentation using the C4 model. A **manual reference architecture** was compared with **automated models generated by GPT-4o and a fine-tuned assistant ("C4 Designer")**, based on a real industrial use case in a regulated domain.

### ✅ **Efficiency Gains**
LLM-based modeling significantly reduced time:
- ⏱️ 60% at container level  
- ⏱️ 80% at component level  
- ⏱️ 97% at code level  

### 📊 **Evaluation**
28 experts assessed quality using structured rating forms.  
GPT-generated documentation reached **93% of the manual benchmark** (46.8 vs. 50.5 out of 60 points).  
**Strengths:** Clarity and layout  
**Weaknesses:** Domain-specific accuracy and relationship logic

### 🧠 **Perception**
- 68% preferred the LLM approach for time savings  
- 54% would adopt it as a long-term practice  
- Confidence in AI replacement: **7.7/10**

The thesis provides a reproducible workflow, prompt engineering patterns, and empirical benchmarks for further research and industry adoption.
